    I was able to connect what i learned last week to todays lesson. Right now I am working on finishing my webpage on my protfolio and studying things I didnt understand in class, such as var and scope. Which those two thing are blocking me from being able tp fully
    understand the lesson.

    Right now I am working on the FooBar challenge. We have learned about starting Alerts and taking input from our page users. the only thing blocking me today from completeing the challenge is because i dont understand every step. so i doubt my abilities to solve the problems.
